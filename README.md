# How to play

To move forward, press and hold W. You can also turn left and right with A and D respectively. The little white triangles that fly around at times are Friends! Pick them up to boost your firepower, or, when you have the max amount of friends, a big point boost!

The goal is to destroy asteroids to gain points, to get as high as you can on the scoreboard! Can you beat my score? 

Also, when you get enough points, watch out for the Evil Red Skull! &#931;:3c
